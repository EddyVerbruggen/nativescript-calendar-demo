# nativescript-calendar demo app

Demo app for the {N} [calendar plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nativescript-calendar)

## Installation

This app is built with the [NativeScript CLI](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli).
Once you have the [CLI installed](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli#installation), start by cloning the repo:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/nativescript-calendar-demo
$ cd nativescript-calendar-demo
```

Next, install the app's iOS and Android runtimes, as well as the app's npm dependencies:

```
$ tns install
```

From there you can use the `run` command to run the demo app on iOS:

```
$ tns run ios --emulator
```

.. or on Android

```
$ tns run android --emulator
```


## Tips
If you run this on an Android emulator, make sure to add a Calendar in the device's Calendar app first,
otherwise no events can be added.
